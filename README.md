# Degrees of Inequality

This project aims to explore the non-changing levels of racial wealth gap, even with increasing numbers of Bachelor's degree attainment by Black Americans.

## Technical Information

The website was built using Svelte and Vite 'from scratch' in order to get a deeper understanding of modern web development.
Through this project, I became more confident with Git, GitHub, Vite, and integrating Svelte libraries.

## Credits
Repo created using vite (`npm create vite@6`). The illustration was drawn by me, taking the work "Vozes Negras" by Luciano Cian as reference. All data sources are cited in the text with links to the original websites. ChatGPT was used when I got stuck: 1) I couldn't add 3 pie charts next to each other. 2) The background image was not getting built. 2) Got some ideas about the order of the data and commenting on graphs.

Got the icons from Font Awesome and the fonts from Google Fonts.
