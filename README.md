# Degrees of Inequality

This project aims to explore the non-changing levels of the racial wealth gap, even with increasing numbers of Bachelor's degree attainment by Black Americans.

## Technical Information

The website was built using Svelte and Vite 'from scratch' in order to get a deeper understanding of modern web development.
Through this project, I became more confident with Git, GitHub, Vite, and integrating Svelte libraries.

## Credits
Repo created using vite (`npm create vite@6`). The illustration was drawn by me, taking the work "Vozes Negras" by Luciano Cian as reference. All data sources are cited in the text with links to the original websites.
